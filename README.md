## Introduction

This project is designed to build a full-stack project using some of the most popular modern technologies. Throughout this project, I will build a coding platform that allows users to log in, solve coding problems, and track their progress.

## Project Setup

We'll start by setting up the development environment, ensuring I have all the necessary tools installed. This includes setting up React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase, WebSocket, Redis, MongoDB, Zod.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and password reset functionality.
- **Home Page & Problems Table**: Clean and responsive UI for displaying coding problems.
- **YouTube Video Modal**: Interactive modal for video tutorials.
- **Code Editor & Test Cases**: A custom-built code editor for solving problems with real-time feedback.
- **Data Handling**: Fetching and managing problem data with Firebase and Firestore.
- **Interactive Features**: Like, dislike, and star functionality for problem solutions.
- **Code Submission**: Submit solutions and save progress using local storage.
- **Settings Modal**: Customize user settings through a dedicated UI.
- **Error Handling**: Debug common issues like hydration errors in Next.js.
